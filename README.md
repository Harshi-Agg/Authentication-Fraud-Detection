# Authentication-Fraud-Detection
ML system to detect fraudulent authentication attempts that process login data,  and generate fraud risk scores

# Authentication Fraud Detection

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation and experimental study of **Authentication Fraud Detection** techniques inspired by an existing research paper.  
The objective of this project is to understand, reproduce, and practically evaluate the ideas proposed in the referenced work using real-world datasets and machine learning techniques.

This work is intended **strictly for academic and learning purposes**.

## Reference Research Paper
This project is **based on and inspired by** the following research paper:

**Title:** Authentication Fraud Detection using Machine Learning  
**Source:** IJNRD (International Journal of Novel Research and Development)  
**Paper ID:** IJNRD2505325  

The original paper proposes a methodology for detecting fraudulent authentication behavior using machine learning-based anomaly detection and pattern analysis.

> ⚠️ Note:  
> This repository is **not an official implementation** by the original authors.  
> The code is written independently by the authors of this repository as part of an academic exercise.
